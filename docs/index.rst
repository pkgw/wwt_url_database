wwt_url_database: checking that WorldWide Telescope URLs are live
=================================================================

The AAS `WorldWide Telescope <http://worldwidetelescope.org/home>`_ is a free
and powerful visualization engine developed by the `American Astronomical
Society <https://aas.org/>`_ that can display astronomical and planetary data.
This engine is powered by a large (multi-terabyte) collection of astronomical
survey data stored in the cloud. The ``wwt_url_database`` package is a utility
for checking that the URLs exposed by the web service are functioning
correctly.
